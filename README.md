# Form-Arrow-Navigation
This repository allows users to navigate their forms, using up and down arrow keys like you would do in a worksheet cells.

Most times when working in forms lie in a signup or data entry form online, users always want to use the arrow keys to navigate their movement, so this repository allows that functionality to be included in your web project.
